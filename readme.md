Stuck on a tricky problem?  Not sure what you need to implement a new feature?  Talk it out!  

## Project primary goals
* Write a program that can be on any computer with an attached microphone and speaker
* The program will respond to audio prompts that begin with a trigger keyword
* Audio prompts are transcribed to text
* Prompt transcriptions are sent to OpenAI through their API
* OpenAI API responses are passed through a text-to-speech API
* The response from the text-to-speech API is played back over an attached audio output device

## Project Stretch goals
* The keyword can be customized
* The project can be configured with budget/credit constraints for the associated API services
* The project will include default audio output for API failures
* The project will include default audio output when budget constraints would be exceeded
